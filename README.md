# Hey there, I'm Sudhanshu 👋

I'm a software developer who loves building things that solve real problems. I work across backend engineering, AI/ML tooling, and DevOps mostly in the Microsoft ecosystem, but I enjoy exploring Go and Python when the problem calls for it.

## 🛠️ Stuff I Work With

- **Languages:** C#, Go, Python
- **Tools & Frameworks:** .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, Semantic Kernel, Spectre.Console
- **DevOps & Infra:** Kubernetes, Docker, Grafana, Redis, YAML
- **AI Stuff:** Custom AI agents, vector embeddings, similarity searches

## 🚀 What I'm Up To Right Now

- Building production-grade AI agents and custom MCP servers
- Creating intuitive CLI applications with neat and clean designs
- Experimenting with streaming APIs using .NET Core
- Deepening my understanding of computer architecture and designing scalable systems

## 🌱 Stuff I'm Curious About

- Instruction pipelining, caching, parallelism, and low-level architecture
- Distributed systems, service layers, and scalable backend design
- Performance tuning using async, concurrency, and low-latency patterns in C# and Go
- Combining AI, infra, and backend engineering to build real products

Always down to chat, learn, or collaborate on cool ideas!
